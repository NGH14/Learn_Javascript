# [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

**_TypeScript is JavaScript with syntax for types._**

> TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.

## [Installation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/download/)

> TypeScript can be installed through three installation routes depending on how you intend to use it: an npm module, a NuGet package or a Visual Studio Extension.

### NPM

_TypeScript is available as a package on the npm registry available as "typescript"._
You will need a copy of Node.js as an environment to run the package. Then you use a dependency manager like npm, yarn or pnpm to download TypeScript into your project.

```bash
npm install typescript --save-dev
```

All of these dependency managers support lockfiles, ensuring that everyone on your team is using the same version of the language. You can then run the TypeScript compiler using one of the following commands:

```bash
npx tsc
```
